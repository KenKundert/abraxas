pw: A Password Generator
========================

This password generator replaces a conventional password manager. The intent is 
not to store passwords, but rather to regenerate them as needed. This is done 
with the aid of two files. The first is an accounts file that contains useful 
information about each account along with the parameters that control how the 
password is generated for that account (which style of password to generate, how 
many characters or words to include, what alphabet to use, etc.) The second is 
the master password file. When you go to use the password generator, you will 
first need to unlock the master password file. You do so by providing its pass 
phrase, which only you should know. Thus, only you will be capable of generating 
the passwords associated with your accounts. Once generated, you can specify 
that they be displayed on the standard output, you can specify that they be 
copied to the clipboard, or you can specify that they be typed into some other 
program.

In your master password file you can store more than one master password (the 
password used to generate the passwords for your accounts). In this way this 
password generator makes it easy to collaborate with friends and colleagues.  
Simply start by sharing a master password that you only use for shared accounts. 
A password generated for a particular account is computed from the name of the 
account and the master password. Since you are sharing the master password, you 
will both generate the same password for an account as long as you both use the 
same name for the account. In other words, if Alice and Bob share a master 
password, and if Alice wants to create a Google Docs account for sharing 
documents with Bob, she need only create the account using the password 
generated by PW using the shared master password, and then simply tells Bob that 
she has created a Google Docs account with the name "alice-bob-docs" and 
uploaded several documents.  Without actually sharing the password, Bob uses the 
shared master password and the account name to regenerate the accounts password 
himself and downloads the documents.

PW requires the following packages to fully function::

    # yum install python3
    # yum install python3-setuptools (for installation)
    # easy_install-3.3 python-gnupg
    # easy_install-3.3 argparse
    # easy_install-3.3 docutils (for manpages)
    # yum install xdotool (autotype support)
    # yum install xsel (clipboard support)
    # yum install zenity (account selection when window title is not enough)
    # yum install PyYAML (password archive)

Or, you can install Python from source. First get and install Python using::
    $ cd ~/packages/python
    $ wget http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.3.2/Python-3.3.2.tgz
    $ tar zxf Python-3.3.2.tgz
    $ cd Python-3.3.2
    $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
    $ make
    $ make install

Now get easy_install::
    $ wget -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py
    $ python3.3 distribute_setup.py

Then you can use easy_install to install python-gnupg, argparse, and docutils as 
above.

To install, edit the install file and make sure your version of python is listed
in supportedPythonVersions. Then::

    $ ./install

The program along with the man pages should end up in ~/.local.

To be able to easily edit the master password file, download the gnupg vim
plugin from::

    http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3645

Then copy it into::

    cp gnupg.vim .vim/plugin

Once installed, you should be able to get information as follows::

    $ man pw     (information on how to use pw from the command line)
    $ man 3 pw   (information on how to use the pw API)
    $ man 5 pw   (information about the configuration files)
