pw: A Password Generator
========================

This password generator replaces a conventional password manager. The intent is 
not to store passwords, but rather to regenerate them as needed. This is done 
with the aid of two files. The first is an accounts file that contains useful 
information about each account along with the parameters that control how the 
password is generated (which style of password to generate, how many characters 
or words to include, what alphabet to use, etc.) The second is the master 
password file. When you go to use the password generator, you will first need to 
unlock the master password file. You do so by providing its pass phrase, which 
only you should know. Thus, only you will be capable of the passwords associated 
with your accounts. Once generated, you can specify that they be displayed on 
the standard output, you can specify that they be copied to the clipboard, or 
you can specify that they be typed into some other program.

In your master password file you can store more than one master password (the 
password used to generate the passwords for your accounts). In this way this 
password generator makes it easy to collaborate with friends and colleagues.  
Simply start by sharing a master password that you only used for shared 
accounts. A password generated for a particular account is computed from the 
name of the account and the master password. Since you are sharing the master 
password, you will both generate the same password for an account as long as you 
both use the same name for the account. In other words if Alice and Bob share 
a master password, and if Alice wants to create a Google Docs account for 
sharing documents with Bob, she need only create the account using the password 
generated by PW using the shared master password, and then simply tells Bob that 
she has created a Google Docs account with the name "alice-bob-docs" and 
uploaded several documents.  Without actually sharing the password, Bob use the 
shared master password and the account name to regenerate the accounts password 
himself and downloads the documents.

PW requires the following packages to fully function:

    # yum install python3
    # easy_install-3.3 python-gnupg
    # easy_install-3.3 argparse
    # yum install python3-setuptools (for installation)
    # yum install python3-doctools (for manpages)
    # yum install xdotool (autotype support)
    # yum install xsel (clipboard support)
    # yum install zenity (account selection when window title is not enough)

To install, edit the install file and make sure your version of python is listed
in supportedPythonVersions. Then,
    $ ./install

The program along with the man pages should end up in ~/.local.

To be able to easily edit the master password file, download the gnupg vim
plugin from:
    http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3645
Then copy it into:
    cp gnupg.vim .vim/plugin

Once installed, you should be able to get information as follows:
    $ man pw     (information on how to use pw from the command line)
    $ man 3 pw   (information on how to use the pw API)
    $ man 5 pw   (information about the configuration files)
